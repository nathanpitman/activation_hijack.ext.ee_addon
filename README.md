activation_hijack.ext.ee_addon
==============================

Allows for the hijack of member activation/validation

In it's current guise this extension does one job, it prevents the user from seeing any kind of error message if they try to activate their account following manual assignment of their account to a non pending member group.

This could be extended to perform additional actions following a sucessful or unsuccessful member activation, for example creating an associated entry, fetching user details from social networking sites based on the data a user submitted at registration etc.
